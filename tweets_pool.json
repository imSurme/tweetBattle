    "text": "Recently, @PlutusDAO_io has proposed \" ARB staking \" to improve the utility of $ARB . ~ 90% of voters have voted Yes And If the proposal pass, Arbitrum DAO treasury will need to fund the staking APY with 1.75% of the total ARB token supply . This could lead to as much as a 137% staking APY for $ARB . However, is this proposal beneficial for Arbitrum in the long term ? Some quick thought on the proposal : --------------------------------------------------------- A TLDR of the proposal: Plutus has proposed a staking mechanism aimed at incentivizing long-term holders and adding utility to the ARB token. Users can lock up their ARB for up to 365 days, or choose to exit early with a penalty ranging from 0-60%. This penalty gets redistributed to other ARB stakers based on their stake weight, and locking do not affect a staker voting right. To bring this to reality, the proposal requests a certain percentage of the total ARB token supply from ARB DAO to fund the staking APY in the next 12 months, which are: Fund with 1.75% of total ARB supply Fund with 1.5% Fund with 1.25%, Fund with 1%, No funding at all By the time of writing, ~90% have chosen options 1. Option 1 has an estimated staking APR of 137.25% when 10% of ARB is locked and decreases to 13.73% when 100% of ARB is locked. Link to the proposal in the comment session . --------------------------------------------------------- My tiny brain thoughts: First, I agree that staking could indeed improve the utility of ARB by being more than a governance token. More than that, staking can lock up a portion of the circulating supply and rewarding lockers with an attractive APY funded by the @arbitrum DAO treasury. Second, looking beyond, this proposal could even serve as a foundation for future revenue-sharing models, such as sharing sequencer fees or DAO-earned interest, and so forth . However, my primary concern with this proposal is the potential for inflation in the long run, as $ARB from the treasury would be distributed to ARB stakers as rewards, leading to unnecessary selling pressure in the future. Moreover, the 1.75% of the ARB supply could potentially be put to better use. For example, it could fund another round of incentives to attract more projects and developers, or reward existing projects that have been contributing to Arbitrum's development, Rather than merely paying users to hold their tokens for 12 months. Given these concerns and the lack of benefits to the ARB ecosystem as a whole, I would disagree with the proposal. Im happy to have your thoughts on this one tho. Feel free to discuss!",

In this cruel dance of fate, our paths must sever, And I, a grieving father, bear the weight of loss. Oh, cancer's grip, a relentless, vicious foe, That steals your breath, while my soul crumbles slowly. In the darkness, I yearn for the light that once shone, But fate's relentless hand won't let me say goodbye. I watch you fade, consumed by this vicious foe, As sorrow weaves its web around my fragile heart. I cling to memories, fragile fragments of loss, While love's embrace slips away, a tether is severed. The days grow colder, and the ties we held sever, Like brittle autumn leaves, withered, no longer shone. Despair's cruel tendrils tighten, a grip of loss, As hope dissolves, I must bid you goodbye. Oh, how I long to shield you with my wounded heart, But cancer's cruel dance continues as an unyielding foe. Through sleepless nights, I battle this relentless foe, A warrior crumbling, as all my strength severs. How can I find solace, when my shattered heart Aches for the warmth of your smile forever shone. In the depths of my sorrow, I must say goodbye, Destiny’s cruel hand has dealt this crushing loss. Yet, in my dreams, I'll hold you, release this loss, And face the darkness, fearless against this foe. I'll whisper words of love as I say goodbye, Knowing that even as our paths forever sever, Our bond, like stars in the night sky, will brightly shine, A testament to a father's unbreakable heart. With each teardrop shed, my aching heart does sever, As I face the loss, this relentless, cruel foe. But love's light will forever shine, in memories brightly shone.

    "text": "The @lemkininstitute for Genocide Prevention offers its condolences to the government of the United States of America for the untimely demise of the temporary pier off the coast of Gaza. The US decided to close the pier by the end of July, after ongoing problems with weather and logistics. The effort to provide aid to the Palestinians of Gaza through the pier ultimately delivered around 8,100 metric tons of humanitarian supplies to shore, a cost of $28,395 per metric ton. The majority of this humanitarian aid has sat in a nearby warehouse due to Israel's unwillingness to ensure the safety of aid groups who would distribute it. The misadventure only saw supplies moved across the pier for 20 total days over nearly 3 months at a cost of $230 million dollars in #us taxpayer money. While the Lemkin Institute recognizes that all help is needed in a place where nearly every one of the 2.15 million people in Gaza faces acute food insecurity and 500,000 are on the brink of starvation, the pier has been an embarrassment and is widely viewed as nothing but an #aid -washing stunt to by time for Israel's genocidal campaign. One can ask whether such ineffective and indeed farcical stunts are the best way for the United States to leverage its massive global power. If the goal of the pier was to help supplies flow to Palestinians cut off by Israel's blockade of humanitarian efforts, the most direct path forward would have been -- and still is -- to stop giving the Israeli Defense Force billions of dollars of weapons that daily visit genocidal horrors on the people of Gaza.",

My husband and I will continue to dedicate ourselves to guiding our three sons on how to engage with women respectfully, emphasizing that fostering relationships characterized by safety and security is the essential approach to truly winning a woman's heart.

Le dictateur azerbaïdjanais Aliyev, auteur des attaques majeures de 2020, 2022, 2023 envers l’Arménie et l’Artsakh/Haut-Karabagh (deux démocraties) réclame maintenant ouvertement le Syunik (= partie sud de l'Arménie) et tout le reste de l'Arménie qu'il considère comme partie intégrante de son pays ! Il masse des troupes à la frontière Sud de l'Arménie. Il a reçu ces derniers jours de nouvelles livraisons d’armes Galvanisé par l’impunité dont il jouit il ose même se comparer à l’Ukraine en se disant \"pays occupé qui la comprend pour avoir subi la même chose qu'elle » Il coupe les liens diplomatiques, rejette toutes les médiations de pays tiers et a créé de toutes pièces de nouvelles cartes de la région pour justifier ses conquêtes. Et l'Occident dans tout cela ? @antonioguterres félicite Aliyev pour la #COP29 . @CharlesMichel félicite le dictateur pour sa « réélection\" (94% des voix !). @JosepBorrell ne veut pas nommer l'agresseur alors que 4 soldats arméniens viennent d'être assassinés sur leur propre sol par l’armée terroriste . L’Arménie craint le pire, hier matin l'ambassadrice alertait sur le risque d'une nouvelle attaque imminente. Comble du comble, les dernières \"négociations\" entre le président Pashinyan , le dictateur Aliyev et le chancelier allemand Scholtz se sont tenues à Munich - et ont tourné court. C'est à Munich en 1938 que les Alliés abandonnèrent la Tchécoslovaquie aux nazis, dernière marque de faiblesse fatale qui mena à la Seconde guerre mondiale. Aujourd'hui, aucun dirigeant ne peut prétendre ignorer ce qui se passe. L’Arménie , ses 3 millions d'habitants et son patrimoine exceptionnel sont en danger. C'est tout de suite qu’il faut agir et bloquer le dictateur fou et sanguinaire. Se taire, c'est être complice = #StandWithArmenia #SanctionAliyev",

    "text": "| For the first time, #Bethlehem has not set up a #Christmas tree in Manger Square. Instead, it was replaced with a model representing the damage inflicted on #Gaza . Only religious ceremonies will take place in the birthplace of Jesus. This symbolism depicts the suffering of the first #Palestinian refugee family, who endured oppression and displacement, fleeing to #Egypt after the birth of Jesus Christ. The scene displays the immense destruction and imperialist-backed genocide over decades, a scene words alone cannot describe. The Virgin Mary is seen embracing Jesus in a way resembling the mothers of martyrs, while Joseph comforts her amidst their deep sorrow. The angels hanging around the rubble represent the souls of children, martyrs of repeated massacres throughout history, starting from the massacre of Bethlehem's children by Herod at the time of Jesus' birth, through various historical massacres by colonial entities against the Palestinian people and their ancestors, up to the present-day massacres in Gaza by the occupation. This year, the Magi will not bring gold, frankincense, and myrrh, but a white shroud. The shepherd, forced to leave the manger, walks away carrying a bundle symbolizing Palestinian displacement. The completely destroyed house mimics the traditional form of Jesus Christ's manger, while the roof, depicted from an \"overhead view,\" is in the shape of the Gaza Strip. This time, it has been bombed, and its shattered roof forms a star from which light is emitted, inspired by the Star of Bethlehem. This light represents a message of great hope despite immense sorrow. #Gaza_Genocide #WestBank #Palestine",

    "text": "I am super excited to finally announce that we ( @towards_AI ) released our first book: Building LLMs for Production. Put a dozen experts (graduates and industry) and 1.5 years of work, and that's what you get... \"...the most comprehensive textbook to date on building LLM applications, and helps learners understand everything from fundamentals to the simple-to-advanced building blocks of constructing LLM applications [...] - all essential topics in an AI Engineer's toolkit.\" - @jerryjliu0 , CEO of @llama_index . One of the reasons I quit my PhD in AI was to build practical solutions that will help others in the real world and improve what exists. While I love the world of academia, when I first stepped into the startup world, it felt like I pretty much knew nothing all over again. I needed to understand the problems in the real-world application of AI and build solutions for it. Not just research but real models, real products, and real people using them. But here's the thing: grasping these challenges is merely the first step. For the ‘how’ part of it, you need to get into the code, the architecture, the models, the APIs, the deployments, the trials and errors, and the complex and wide varieties of frameworks - you don't have time to reinvent the wheel in a startup! So we've gathered everything we worked on and with in this 470-page book all about LLMs and how to work with them. Right now, this means working with @llama_index , @LangChainAI , @activeloopai and other of such amazing tools, but we believe the book still teaches concepts that will stay relevant for a long time even as LLMs get better, such as reducing hallucinations, teaching how to work and use them, some cool theory and tips and more. The only skill required for the book is some Python (or programming) knowledge. I'd love to hear what you think of the book: https:// amzn.to/4bqYU9b I also want to thank some of our amazing team at Towards AI that helped achieve this, including @AlaFalaki , @omar_solano1 , Pratik Shukla, @fabiochiusano , Rucha Bhide, @_LouiePeters , Denis Piffaretti, Vamsikrishna (Vamsi) Chemudupati, Mizanur Rahman and others... A big thanks to some of our reviewers and my friends for the support, @KenJee_DS , @nonmayorpete , Greg Coquillo, Shashank Kalanithi, @SerranoAcademy , @jerpint , Rafid Al-Humaimidi, Sander Schulhoff, @Coffee_and_NLP , Shaw Talebi, @ahmed_moubtahij , @AICoffeeBreak , @hellotinah , Jack Blandin, Davide Coccomini... Lastly, thank you, @NickSinghTech , for all the tips and help with the book process and everything related to it. \"Building LLMs for Production: Enhancing LLM Abilities and Reliability with Prompting, Fine-Tuning, and RAG\" is now available on Amazon: https:// amzn.to/4bqYU9b We are also on Goodreads with the same name. If you want to support us for free, give a review there. :)",

And why didn't the Native Americans simply file a formal complaint when their land was taken away? Surely the colonizers would have listened to some well-organized feedback. By the way, instead of dumping tea into Boston Harbor, why didn't the American colonists just start a British-themed tea subscription box? That way, they could keep the tea while making a profit. Finally, if Gaza has been free since 2005, why did they waste time on rockets instead of opening at least one McDonald's with a rocket-themed Happy Meal? Clearly, all these groups just lacked a bit of entrepreneurial spirit. If they had been a bit more innovative, history could've been much different. Watch the video (with English captions) and you'll finally see just how many historical tidbits you've managed to miss. #Palestine",

The resolution, initially introduced in July by a series of GOP Senators and placed on the calendar last week, disagrees with recent guidance by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in relation to sex discrimination. The USDA had said it is updating its policies regarding discrimination based on sex to include sexual orientation and gender identity, in accordance with President Biden’s executive order on the matter in 2021. Schools that receive funds from the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) will have to have policies that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity and investigate any forms of alleged discrimination based on those factors. #wtpBLUE #DemVoice1 #FreshStrong",
